Library to solve software architecture and physical problems with dimensionless analysis and the Pi-Theorem

## Requirements

I need an object oriented design option to include the following requirements in its specifications

- to manage for fundamental dimensions (traditional and extendable to software architecture)
- to manage dimensional parameters and variables, recognizing parameters as ageneralizaction of input, aoutput and control variables, it has to have a name, a symbol, a range (min, max, step) and dimensions.
- to manage manage the data for meassurements and metrics in the real world and software architecture. it need to manage imperial and metrics units and be related with the dimensional parameters.
- to manage dimensionless coefficients or numbers (they ar synonym) with their name, symbol, formula, and relation to their dimensional parameters.
- to classify the dimensionless coefficients based on non repeatable and repetead dimensional parameters.
- to create algorithmically the dimensionless coefficients with a four-step method described as follows:
  * To create a complete  and mutually independent parameters (variables and constants) thought to be relevant for the process and that can influence the phenomena, this is called a relevance list.
  * To shape this relevance list into a matrixial form divided into two parts. The square core matrix; and the residual matrix. The former contains the fundamental dimensions in the rows (i.e.: L, M, and T, or A, D, and, T) and the most critical dimensional variables as columns (i.e.: ρ, L, and V) and the latter contains the rest of the independently significant variables as columns; in particular, the variable we want to predict as the first one.
  * To linearly transform the core matrix into a unity matrix (ones as diagonal values, and the remaining elements are zero).
  * To divide the variables of the residual matrix by the variables of the unity matrix with the exponents indicated by the unit values of the residual matrix to generate DC/DN.
- to check the principle of similitude for traditional problems and extendable into software architecture.
- to calculate the dimensionless coefficient range (min, max) and the influence of their dimensional parameters in their behaviour.
- to simulate the dimensionless formula with its coeffcients and have a detailed behavioural data.
- to plot or graph possible dimensionless charts using the behaviour of dimensionless coefficients and the dimensional parameters.
