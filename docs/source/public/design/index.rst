Design & Architecture
=====================

Guided by **PyDASA**'s core mission stated in the epic user story below, this section details the requirements, architecture, and design decisions that shape the library's implementation.

    **Epic User Story**
    ^^^
    **As a** researcher, engineer, or software architect analyzing complex systems,
    
    **I want** a comprehensive dimensional analysis library implementing the Buckingham Pi theorem,
    
    **So that** I can systematically discover dimensionless relationships, validate models, and understand system behavior across physical, computational, and software architecture domains.
